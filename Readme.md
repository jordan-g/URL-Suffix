# URL Suffix Safari Extension

Safari extension that lets you append a suffix to the domain of the currently-opened website.

For example, if the current page's URL is https://example.com/stuff/etc, clicking the
extension's toolbar button or selecting the contextual menu item will open the URL
https://example.com.suffix/stuff/etc, where __suffix__ is specified in the extension's
Preferences.
